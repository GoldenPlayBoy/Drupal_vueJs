*Contenta Vue Nuxt* is a [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org) front-end consumer example for [Contenta CMS](http://www.contentacms.org/), pulling data from its [Contenta public API example](https://live-contentacms.pantheonsite.io/api) to build a fictive recipes site. You can see it live here : https://contentanuxt.now.sh/

This project helps you to start a decoupled Drupal 8 website with JSON API and Vue.js, with a concrete and simple example. 

**We strongly believe than a good headless Drupal has to be SEO-friendly and fast**. That's why we are using the awesome [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) : Nuxt.js is just Vue.js with automatic Server Side Rendering and Code Splitting, so you don't have to deal yourself with all that stuff; and just enjoy your SEO-friendly site built with your Vue.js components.
