## CONTRIBUTORS : WHAT OUR OBJECTIVES, WHY ARE WE DOING THIS ?

1) Helping developers to start quickly a Drupal 8 headless with JSON API module or Contenta CMS.
2) Mirror Vue.js values : un-opinionated, easy to read and learn. That's why we should avoid **over-engineering** to focus on keeping a **low barrier to entry** to Vue.js + Nuxt.js stack. 
4) This application MUST be SEO-friendly, because this is why **Nuxt.js** is used.
5) Let's try to do something than can be easily forked to start your own D8 headless site.
